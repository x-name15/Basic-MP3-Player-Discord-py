# Basic-MP3-Player-Discord-py
This is a Basic MP3 player using Discord.py and FFmpeg, it would be good to host it in replit
###Important-Issues-Some-things
1. The queue command doesnÂ´t work, you will have to use the "skip" command to reproduce the next song
2. The files for the music always will be MP3, DO NOT PUT OTHER FORMAT LIKE FLAC OR WAV
3. The embed on discord will only display if the list is under 1024 caracters, keep that in mind if you want to add more music in the files
