# Basic-MP3-Player-Discord-py
This is a Basic MP3 player using Discord.py and FFmpeg, it would be good to host it in replit

## Hey, welcome back mate
A while ago I carried out this experiment in replit, I wanted to see how FFmpeg worked, until I saw that replit had some problems using the tool, the "replit.nix" file is the configuration environment file so you can take it into account
> Be happy with this little experiment and modify it as much as you want :D

### Important-Issues-Some-things
1. The queue command doesnÂ´t work, you will have to use the "skip" command to reproduce the next song
2. The files for the music always will be MP3, DO NOT PUT OTHER FORMAT LIKE FLAC OR WAV
3. The embed on discord will only display if the list is under 1024 caracters, keep that in mind if you want to add more music in the files
